# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components despite correctly using the classes.

## Problem

The problem lies within the `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file.  If this array doesn't correctly point to all the files containing your Tailwind classes, Tailwind won't be able to process them.  This is often caused by incorrect paths or missing file extensions.

## Solution

The provided solution includes a corrected `tailwind.config.js` that correctly specifies the path to the files which are using Tailwind classes.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Observe the missing styles in the `index.html` initially, then the working styles after applying the solution.

Feel free to modify the code to match your project structure and file types.
